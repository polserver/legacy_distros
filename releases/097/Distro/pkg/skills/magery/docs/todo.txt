TODO:
Recall might not make any sounds
Change all spell scripts to use MS_PlaySpellSFX/GFX(), circles 6+
Function to test config file, calls functions for sfx and gfx and makes sure there are no errors
Check spell_sounds.inc for sanity
Add ID tags to all files
Modify sendstats packet hook to correctly send resistances for debuging.
Field spells are not setup correctly, "1d2" for cprop isn't a struct
Finish implementing new targetting changes circles 1+
Finish debugging why the new playspell*fx stuff is crashing clients


TODO not in magery:
Traps set on containers are not run when opened (needs to check/run scripts in use script)
When teleported into a tile with a walk-on script, it might not be activated
Last I checked, end scripts were not being called by timedScripts
I don't think characters unparalyze after taking damage
What happens if a server crashes before a timed script finishes?
Can timed scripts be run multiple times?


Would be nice:
Poison prevents bandages from healing damage, heal spells will also not work.
Damages appear TWICE above character when hit with direct damage spell, not sure why
Spells don't do much checking for locked down objects, objects in houses, etc...
Not sure what happens if you cast a timedScript spell multiple times on OSI. "This spell is already in effect." ?
You may be able to cast some spells as area, like lightning
Some spells randomly say "I am frozen and cannot move." even though I'm not doing anything.

Curse -	Reduces a player’s maximum elemental resistances to 60% (but only when cast by another player), as well as act like Clumsy, Feeble mind and Weaken all in one.
Bless - Counteracts stats effects and does all three good stat effects

Summon spells probably wont be able to work until brainAI is finished and all NPCs are converted.
