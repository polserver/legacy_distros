TODO:
Recall might not make any sounds
Function to test config file, calls functions for sfx and gfx and makes sure there are no errors
Check spell_sounds.inc for sanity
Add ID tags to all files
Field spells are not setup correctly, "1d2" for cprop isn't a struct
Finish debugging why the new playspell*fx stuff is crashing clients
Create NPCs in brainAI for summoned monsterz


TODO - not in magery package:
Modify sendstats packet hook to correctly send resistances for debuging?
Traps set on containers are not run when opened (needs to check/run scripts in use script)
  Make sure I'm actually using the code correctly...
When teleported into a tile with a walk-on script, it might not be activated
I don't think characters unparalyze after taking damage
Yukiko says timed scripts are loopy when it comes to logging off and back on
In damage:damage, ApplyDamageEx converts all damage to int when ApplyDamage says it can handle real numbers


Would be nice:
Poison prevents bandages from healing damage, heal spells will also not work.
Damages appear TWICE above character when hit with direct damage spell, not sure why
Spells don't do much checking for locked down objects, objects in houses, etc...
Not sure what happens if you cast a timedScript spell multiple times on OSI. "This spell is already in effect." ?


For my own notes, don't think these work exactly right yet:
Curse -	Reduces a player’s maximum elemental resistances to 60% (but only when cast by another player), as well as act like Clumsy, Feeble mind and Weaken all in one.
Bless - Counteracts stats effects and does all three good stat effects
