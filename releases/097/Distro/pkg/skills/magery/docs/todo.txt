wait for crashes to stop :)

end scripts for weaken, clumsy, etc... are not being called so mods never go away
there need to be extra checks for locked down items and other weirdness
i think there is a different type of message if a timed spell is already in affect
finish sendstats packet modification to send resistances
sound/gfx effects could be defined in spells.cfg and called from spell starter, or defined SOMEWHERE
not sure if I'm playing the right effects or for the right time
some spells, like lightning bolt, randomly say "I am frozen and cannot move.", not sure why yet

Lvl 2
Magic Trap	••	Useful for trapping containers, which can break a paralyze spell, but triggering the trap will do 10-50 points damage. Is primarily used to "scare off" thieves these days.
Magic Untrap	•	Remove the trap from an object that has been trapped with the Magic Trap spell. This, of course, is not usable all that often, so the spell could as well be left out of the book.

Lvl 3
Telekinesis	Allows you to use or move an object that is out of reach.	
Teleport	Single Use	Caster is transported to the target location (within the same screen)
(Max distance 11 tiles) Must be a visible location.

Mind Blast damage: Base Damage + ((Magery + Intelligence) / 5) (Drop decimals from result)

protection seems to DECREASE resistng spells

the next spells to implement telekinesis, teleport, magic trap and magic untrap, mana vampire (drains up to Caster's Eval-Target's resist)
Curse -	Reduces a player’s maximum elemental resistances to 60% (but only when cast by another player), as well as act like Clumsy, Feeble mind and Weaken all in one.
Bless - Counteracts stats effects and does all three good stat effects

check all status scripts, see if they work :)

does spell starter really need all those vars on top? it's called by castSpell
