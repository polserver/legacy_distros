Todo:
Casting agility, etc... once it's already on should replace duration with new max
Finish configuring spells.cfg
	most spells need SFX
	most spells without GFX defined need them setup (field spells)
Change all spell scripts to use MS_PlaySpellSFX/GFX()


Add option to be able to cast while paralyzed?
  Check "able to cast" code for user-configurable options
Add ID tags to all files
Modify sendstats packet hook to correctly send resistances for debuging.

Problems (need to reverify):
Poison prevents bandages from healing damage, heal spells will also not work.
Traps set on containers are not run when opened (needs to check/run scripts in use script)
Damages appear TWICE above character when hit with direct damage spell, not sure why
When teleported into a tile with a walk-on script, it might not be activated
Some spells randomly say "I am frozen and cannot move." even though I'm not doing anything.
Spells don't do much checking for locked down objects, objects in houses, etc...
Last I checked, end scripts were not being called by timedScripts.
Not sure what happens if you cast a timedScript spell multiple times on OSI. "This spell is already in effect." ?

Curse -	Reduces a player’s maximum elemental resistances to 60% (but only when cast by another player), as well as act like Clumsy, Feeble mind and Weaken all in one.
Bless - Counteracts stats effects and does all three good stat effects

Summon spells probably wont be able to work until brainAI is finished and all NPCs are converted.
Firefield and other field spells could be aligned with the mobile's facing property

Area Spells: chain lightning, meteor swarm, earthquake
	Should not hit party memberse
	Range is unknown for all three
	Should they trigger "This may flag you a bastard." window?

Do characters unparalyze after taking damage?
What happens if a server crashes before a timed script finishes?
Can timed scripts be run multiple times?
