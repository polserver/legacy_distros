Last I checked, end scripts were not being called by timedScripts.
Not sure what happens if you cast a timedScript spell multiple times on OSI. "This spell is already in effect." ?
Keep in mind that many spells check if an item is locked down or in a house.
Modify sendstats packet hook to correctly send resistances for debuging.
Some spells randomly say "I am frozen and cannot move." even though I'm not doing anything.
Add ID tags to all files
Create a file that CONSTs spell FX

In spells.cfg:
	define spell difficulties

Lvl 2
Magic Trap	Traps do 10-50 pts damage
Magic Untrap	Removes magic trap

Lvl 3
Telekinesis	Move object (not sure how), manipulate containers (opens them?)
Teleport	Teleports character to location 11 tiles max with LOS (not sure about boats, houses, etc...)

Curse -	Reduces a player’s maximum elemental resistances to 60% (but only when cast by another player), as well as act like Clumsy, Feeble mind and Weaken all in one.
Bless - Counteracts stats effects and does all three good stat effects

Summon spells probably wont be able to work until brainAI is finished and all NPCs are converted.
Firefield and other field spells could be aligned with the mobile's facing property

Area Spells: chain lightning, meteor swarm, earthquake
	Should not hit party memberse
	Range is unknown for all three
	Should they trigger "This may flag you a bastard." window?


Do characters unparalyze after taking damage?
What happens if a server crashes before a timed script finishes?
Can timed scripts be run multiple times?


Use teleport vanish after moving character on original location
