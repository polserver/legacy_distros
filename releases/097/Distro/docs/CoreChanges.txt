        Added : PolSys::ListTextCommands() - Returns a dict of a dict of structs.
                Dict 1 - Package names Dict 2 - Command levels Struct - .dir .script
                Example:
                  foreach package in ( commands )
                     Print("Pkg:"+_package_iter);
                     foreach level in ( package )
                        Print(" CmdLvl:"+_level_iter);
                        foreach command in ( level )
                           Print("     "+command);
                           SleepMS(2);
                        endforeach
                        SleepMS(2);
	             endforeach
	  	     SleepMS(2);
	          endforeach

06-22 Austin
        Added : Attributes::GetAttributeName(alias) - Returns the real attribute name from an alias.
        Added : Vitals::GetVitalName(alias) - Returns the real vital name from an alias.
        Added : PolSys::GetCmdLvlName(alias/number) - Returns the real command level name from an alias.

        Added : Cliloc::PrintTextAboveCL() and PrintTextAbovePrivate().
        Added : Support for Talisman layer (layer 9) in core definitions.
        Hint : Quivers (added in ML) share layer 20 with cloaks. You can however
               on Origin equip cloaks AND quivers. Ewwww.

06-20 MuadDib
        Added : Cliloc.em added to the list of new EM Modules. Included in this is already
                the command SendSysMessageCL(). The new EM will have the commands
                commented for instruction of use. If you know about clilocs, you know
                they can be a pain and have additional arguments. Sending normal clilocs
                and ones with arguments are both supported in the single commands.
                Argument flag defaults to 0 in the EM for this.

06-20 Austin
        Changed : Moved guild functions to guilds.em

06-18 Austin
        Changed : Moved storage area functions to storage.em
        Changed : Moved vital functions, ApplyDamage, ApplyRawDamage and HealDamage
                  from uo.em to vitals.em

06-17 Austin
        Changed : Updated handling of object properties and methods. Should provide a slight
                  speed increase.
        Changed : Moved attribute functions from uo.em to a new attributes.em module.

06-16 MuadDib
        Changed : AddMenuItem() now has a color option. Default is 0.
        Hint : menus.cfg uses the color of the itemdesc entry of the objtype given,
               to get color. So if an item has no itemdesc entry, it defaults to 0.

06-16 Austin
        Removed: Skills.cfg is no longer used.
                 Instead skill IDs will be read from uoskills.cfg and redirected to
                 attributes.cfg. The attributes.cfg file now has support for the old entries.
                skills.cfg entries supported now in attributes.cfg are:
                DELAY, UNHIDES and SCRIPT

06-15 Austin
        Added : mobile.Privileges() - Returns a dictionary.
                The key is the privilege name. The value 0/1 is if it is enabled or not.
        Removed: Built-in text commands (you'll need to script them):
                 .eobjcount, .i_help, .log, .los, .objcount, .priv, .privs, .set, .turn,
                 .t_online, .unload, .unloadall, .wheretest

06-15 MuadDib
        Added : Function OpenURL(character, url_string) to OS.EM. Used to send Open Web
                Browser packet to client.

06-14 MuadDib
        Added : AOS style status bar is now generated correctly for AOS+ clients that ALSO
                have the UOExpansion set to AOS or higher. Only thing populated by core is
                the statcap entry. Rest can be done via packethooks.
        Added : UOClient.cfg entry "StatCap" in General. This is used with AOS era
                status bars to send the statcap in the packet. Default is 225. Can use
                packethooks to override this outgoing to client.

06-14 Austin
        Changed : All log files (pol.log, debug.log, start.log, etc.) will now be placed in pol/log/

06-13 Austin
        Changed : Config files in packages can now be in pkgname/config/cfgfile.cfg.
                  If it is not present there, it will look in the package root (pkgname/cfgfile.cfg)
                  pkg.cfg must still be at the root of the package.

06-13 MuadDib
        Changed : Handling of target request returns in core. Returns errors more efficiently
                  when client already has an active target cursor.

06-12 Austin
        Added : UO::CloseTradeWindow(mobile) - Will close the trade window for the mobile and the
                person it is trading with.

06-11 Austin
        Added : mobile.trading_with - Returns a mobile reference if a secure trade is taking place.
        Added : Util::StrFormatTime(format_string, time_stamp).
                Takes in the StrFTime() specifiers for the format string.
                (http://www.cppreference.com/stddate/strftime.html)
                If time_stamp is 0, it will use POLCore().systime.

06-11 MuadDib
        Changed : When a client already has a target cursor request, instead of core
                  just returning that to the new requesting call, now returns an error
                  code back to the calling cursor script.

06-10 MuadDib
        Cleanup : Removed last of stat advancement code. While this was depreciated
                  several versions ago, please remember stat advancement must be done
                  via the scripts.

06-09 MuadDib
        Cleanup : Cleaned out some old code.
        Removed : Removed depreciated UO.EM Function MoveCharacterToLocation(). Use
                  MoveObjectToLocation() now.
        Removed : Removed depreciated UO.EM Function MoveItemToLocation(). Use
                  MoveObjectToLocation() now.
