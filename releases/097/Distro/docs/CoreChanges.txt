        Added : mobile.Privileges() - Returns a dictionary. 
                The key is the privilege name. The value 0/1 is if it is enabled or not.
        Removed: Built-in text commands (you'll need to script them):
                 .eobjcount, .i_help, .log, .los, .objcount, .priv, .privs, .set, .turn, 
                 .t_online, .unload, .unloadall, .wheretest

        Added : AOS style status bar is now generated correctly for AOS+ clients that ALSO
                have the UOExpansion set to AOS or higher. Only thing populated by core is
                the statcap entry. Rest can be done via packethooks.
        Added : UOClient.cfg entry "StatCap" in General. This is used with AOS era
                status bars to send the statcap in the packet. Default is 225. Can use
                packethooks to override this outgoing to client.

        Changed : All log files (pol.log, debug.log, start.log, etc.) will now be placed in pol/log/

06-13 Austin
        Changed : Config files in packages can now be in pkgname/config/cfgfile.cfg.
                  If it is not present there, it will look in the package root (pkgname/cfgfile.cfg)
                  pkg.cfg must still be at the root of the package.

        Changed : Handling of target request returns in core. Returns errors more efficiently
                  when client already has an active target cursor.

        Added : UO::CloseTradeWindow(mobile) - Will close the trade window for the mobile and the 
                person it is trading with.
        
06-11 Austin
        Added : mobile.trading_with - Returns a mobile reference if a secure trade is taking place.
        Added : Util::StrFormatTime(format_string, time_stamp). 
                Takes in the StrFTime() specifiers for the format string.
                (http://www.cppreference.com/stddate/strftime.html)
                If time_stamp is 0, it will use POLCore().systime.

        Changed : When a client already has a target cursor request, instead of core
                  just returning that to the new requesting call, now returns an error
                  code back to the calling cursor script.

        Cleanup : Removed last of stat advancement code. While this was depreciated
                  several versions ago, please remember stat advancement must be done
                  via the scripts.

                  MoveObjectToLocation() now.
        Removed : Removed depreciated UO.EM Function MoveItemToLocation(). Use
                  MoveObjectToLocation() now.
