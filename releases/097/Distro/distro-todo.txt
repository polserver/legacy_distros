This is the current TODO list for the distro. Right now this file is new and I'm (tekproxy) the only one who's updated it, and I mostly stuck to magery so I'm not the best person to write this. :) If anyone else feels like editing the crap out of this file, you just think you can do better, or you want to add something, please do!


Monkey work:
 - NPC definitions
    Should we go with OSI NPC definitions? I intend to write a quick database app so my friends
    can input NPC info from stratics and from there I could dump most of the NPC info into npcdesc.cfg files
    MuadDib mentioned something about greasemonkey scripts for firefox to do all of this work, could be the same for items, maybe.

 - Item definitions
    This would take a little more time to organize once input into a database.

 - World item placement (doors, signs)
    I know one exists and it's probably just a copy/paste job

 - Spawning
    Does anyone know the OSI spawn locations well? I may know someone who can help with this.


Systems:
 - Housing and boats
    I couldn't find any house deeds, only a nearly empty housing package.
    Boat deeds need to have the use script written for them.
    
 - Guilds
    MontuZ says finished and in testing

 - Crafting
    MuadDib is busy making huge piles of money at work

 - Spawning
    Austin said "almost complete"


Skills:
 - magery
    pet AI needs to be implemented in brainAI before summons will work
    tweak skill gains

It would be nice if NPC categories in .createnpc menu were collapseable OR there was a back button of some sort.


Stat advancement for skills is disabled, but looks mostly complete


BrainAI script for merchants, how far along is this?
  - What about skill training?


pkg/items/clothing/config/itemdesc.cfg needs VendorBuy/Sell values, possibly others


Corpses don't decay. Maybe in corpseControl.src:
	if ( corpse.NPCTemplate() ) // should be !corpse.NPCTemplate()?
		return 0;
	endif


Lockpicking and magic unlock both require locks to have different difficulties. This could easily be done with a CProp on every lockable item, something like LockLevel, and it could be an integer from 1 to 100. Does anyone else have a better idea?


Does anyone else think skill gain is either too easy or too hard? I'm having difficulty with scenarios where I'd want a skill to raise once every few hundred tries, and after about 30 skill only gain in 0.1 increments (instead of the occasional 0.3, 0.2).


Merchants from 095 need to be corrected and converted over to use brainAI.


In advanceCheck.inc it makes two checks to see if skill gain should happen. The first is made with a pass_chance, which is calculated in skillCheck.inc. If There was more control over what pass_chance would be, possibly making it an optional paramater for SkillCheck()... The second check is made using an intelligence bonus and a task modifier. I think the bonus should depend on the skill. Swords would be strength, magery int, etc... This is what the OSI website says. I really don't want to ruff up Austin's code since he knows his way around it better. Maybe I am missing something? Maybe if each skill had a difficulty that somehow modified skill checks. That way it'd be easier to configure for new people.


Guards do not work yet. It could be missing the criminal in the look around system, or a gone criminal event or it's not scripted at all.
