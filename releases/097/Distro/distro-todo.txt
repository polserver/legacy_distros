Welcome to the Distro TODO. If you find anything you'd like to help with, just contact me at tekproxy@gmail.com and we can talk about it. If you are aware of anything that should be on this list, please let me know!


BIG STUFF
----------------
NPC definitions
  This may be easy to do with greasemonkey scripts on firefox using the stratics website. Need to look more into this.


Item definitions
  Same as NPC definitions. Hopefully we can get buy/sell values.


World item placement (doors, signs)
  These used to be in the 096 distro so I know they're floating around somewhere.
  Probably just need to copy them over and scrub them clean (wipe message boards, find any "easter eggs" etc...).


Spawning
  If you know OSI spawn locations well, or run a shard with some already set up in your own custom format, we can use the help.


Boats and Housing
  This is almost completely unscripted. The brunt of the work could be done by converting 095 scripts.
   

Crafting
  Very far along. Not sure exactly this is MuadDib's area.


Guilds
  MontuZ reports this system is finished and in testing.


Spawning
  Austin said "almost complete". It doesn't have a web interface.


Merchants
  Can copy over most of the stuff in 095 and get it to work with BrainAI. Merchants should be finished and usable, just not configured.
  Not sure if merchants do training of if there is AI scripted for that...

Guards
  It could be missing the criminal in the look around system, or a gone criminal event or it's not scripted at all.


Corpse decay
  Doesn't work but there is code for it. I think it might be because of:
	if ( corpse.NPCTemplate() ) // should be !corpse.NPCTemplate()?
		return 0;
	endif
  I'll have to check!


Arenas
  Basic framework is there, but otherwise unscripted.



SKILLS
----------------
Some of these skills depend on other systems that are either unfinished or do not exist, but some would be easy. Don't be shy. ;) Any other skills not listed should be considered finished and in testing.

    pet AI must be scripted for summons
    function documentation

Small Stuff
----------------
Find a better place for CONSTs in drinkPotion.inc



Features
----------------
A back button for .createnpc menu

Stat advancement has been enabled, but needs testing

LockLevel cprop defined for every lockable item. LockLevels would go from 1 to 10. Not sure what objects had more difficult locks.
  Lockpicking and magic unlock both require some sort of lock level.

Some steps have been made to move some numbers out of attributes code into config files to make tweaking gain speeds and difficulties easier.
  Still need to do a lot more looking into this....

Limit number of accounts per IP
  This may be easy to do in the accounts package, but might not be important enough to be added for a whlie.

Speech commands
  Could be a script that's started on a player onlogon that registers speech events and processes things like "I must consider my sins."

Make pre-AOS spell resistance a configurable option for magery.
