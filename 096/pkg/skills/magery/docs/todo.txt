end scripts for weaken, clumsy, etc... are not being called so mods never go away
there need to be extra checks for locked down items and other weirdness
i think there is a different type of message if a timed spell is already in affect
finish sendstats packet modification to send resistances
sound/gfx effects could be defined in spells.cfg and called from spell starter
not sure of some of the gfx are played for the right time
finish spell scripts and lots of testing :)
