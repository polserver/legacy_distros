    Changed: Realm Class no longer uses Getxxx() for Realm Info. All Methods dropped Get and
             now are Get/Set methods of Height(), Width(), etc.

	Added  : Added more Paths to PathStorage.
	Added  : New overload for EConfig.Option() so you can pass a bool as the new value.
	         Method auto converts bool to string 0/1.
    Added  : Storage and methods for holding/reading CommandLine flags for ECompile.exe.
             Some NEW flags was added too (that only existed via ecompile.cfg) and those
             was added to 098 ECompile. Will be out in a release soon. DisplayUpToDateScripts
             currently does nothing though hehe.

	Note   : Happy Holidays Everyone!
	Added  : Ecompile Configuration File Reader. Ability to edit settings from the
			 Ecompile.cfg and save them back. Retains all comments etc from the file.
			 All settings are tabbed to column 32 in the file for a straight column.
			 Still need to handle saving PackageRoot settings though.

	Added  : PathStorage Class Object. Uses a Dictionary<string, string> for main
			 private storage. Set up to use Methods to access the dictionary. This
			 storage container is NOT set to be a static set of Paths. The end-user
			 CAN add new paths to the setting via Object Methods in their programs.
			 This way, they can use the DLL's storage for additional Paths without
			 changing a lot in their code.
	Added  : Added UOConvert/UOConvert Config Files/UOConvert Realm.. classes and
			 objects. This is the BASE code for interaction/storage. Does not contain
			 handling of executing UOConvert as of yet.
