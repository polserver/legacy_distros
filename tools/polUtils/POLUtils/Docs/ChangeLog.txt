	Added  : PathStorage Class Object. Uses a Dictionary<string, string> for main
			 private storage. Set up to use Methods to access the dictionary. This
			 storage container is NOT set to be a static set of Paths. The end-user
			 CAN add new paths to the setting via Object Methods in their programs.
			 This way, they can use the DLL's storage for additional Paths without
			 changing a lot in their code.
	Added  : Added UOConvert/UOConvert Config Files/UOConvert Realm.. classes and
			 objects. This is the BASE code for interaction/storage. Does not contain
			 handling of executing UOConvert as of yet.
