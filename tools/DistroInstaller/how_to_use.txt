You need NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net) to compile the 
installer.nsi script.

There must be these folders:

(1) 097\release
(2) 097\Distro


"Distro" is the SVN export from the SVN's "Distro" folder
"release" is the usual .zip from www.polserver.com of a POL release
(this means: pol.exe, uoconvert.exe, em modules, etc...)

When releasing 098, just change all the "097" to "098". :)
