1.) Add Enumeration Object that will store total count of SRC files and ASP
    files for ECompile Progress Bar Handling.
2.) Change UOConvert to use Designer form of Process Control. No need to use the
    custom Console Class for this.
3.) Add Realms Editor for editing Realm Info to allow settings for custom maps.
4.) Make sure Realms information is added to POLLaunch.XML settings.
5.) Add Tooltips and Help Information.
6.) Add Service configuration for POL.Exe and minor interaction (will require some
    core updates for Shutdown/Stop Initialization via PL).
7.) Add Default Checkboxes to be checked on UOConvert Tab to simplify initial setups.
8.) Remove Type of Archive from Data Backup. Do we really need multiple type support??
9.) Update TabIndex Orders on Accounts Tab so user can tab through Create Controls 
    easily.
10.) ECompile needs a buffer and check for updating the Text Output. Updating every
     single line seems to cause the programs to slow down once so much information
     has been added at such a high rate. Possibly update the textbox from a buffer
     after it reaches 20 lines in length then clear the buffer for more storage?
