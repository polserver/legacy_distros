    Added   : Much more ECompile Tab work. Both Visual and Code wise.
              Path Editor in place for Ecompile.cfg. Does not open a new form, but
              rather makes the information visible in existing tab.
    Added   : The 3 main Directory Settings are now visible on the main Ecompile Tab
              and NOT just in the Editor.
    Added   : #region/#endregion to help organize the code and make it easier to navigate.
    Changed : Refactored checkbox1 to CB_StraightToPOL.
    Changed : Reorganized some of the Form Code to go with the new Regions updates.
    Added   : New Exception Form. In places where we add try/catch, if an Exception is thrown
              it opens a new form with Details about the Exception. It gives you a Copy To
              Clipboard button for the info, and a link to click on to report this crash
              to the forums. :P
    Changed : Updated existing Try/Catch sets to use new Exception Form.
    Fixed   : Threading issues with ProgressBar in UOConvert Console.
    Added   : Check to not display all the Converting: xx% lines etc from UOConvert.
    Fixed   : Threading issue with Clearing POL Output Textbox buffer.
    Fixed   : Bug where UO Client Data Path would have spaces in the PathName.
    Changed : Even more code organization for the main form. God I must be bored.
              I blame Nando aka Mr. Clean.
    
12-29-2008 - MuadDib
    Added	: To make Olds Happy, I created the initial Changelog file. Added all SVN
              Logs to this point to note all changes related to POL  Launch :)
    Changed : Moved Console classes over to POLUtil and updated PL to match this new
              change.
    Added   : New Configuration item.. POLTabShutdown setting. This is for the letter you
              wish to send to the POL Console to shut it down. You can use this for the timed
              shutdowns (1-6) or have it point to a custom console command you added for it.
    Changed : Stop POL button activated. Warns you if no configuration is set for the letter.
    Removed : UOPath from Configuration. This is now handled via the UOConvert tab itself. This
              setting is also NOT required. It is used only as an override for the path to the
              MUL Files for UOConvert.
    Changed : VS Complained about CR/LF from the paste of SVN Log. So it updated this file. lol

+ECompile Tab began. So far it can Load and Save all "Default Options" and has checkboxes to change all the Default Compiler Options. (The 0/1 flagged).
+Added path storage for UOConvert.cfg and ECompile.cfg to Configurations.
@Need to add Path editing to the Ecompile for Directory Settings and add actual compile functions.
@Need to actually Implement the Path To UO Client Data to the codebase so it does more than look pretty.

Message:
+Initial Upgrade to include the POLUtils.DLL. To make use of this during edit/compile, you just need to have the POLUtils Project Compiled. (The Resource Link in POL Launch looks to the bin\Release folder for the DLL under POLUtils).
+Additional Browse added for MulPath. Currently no code utilizes this, but it is for UOConvert to allow you to manually set the "uodata=" flag to use MUL Files in a different location than that given by POL.CFG

Message:
+Added Accounts Tab. This will handle basic account creation and manipulation via localhost AuxSvc written for Distro. (Will require some adjustments to the Distro scriptbase, which means YAY! :x )
+Accounts Tab WILL contain settings so you can adjust it for your own Port settings. It will also contain a section for storing an Administrative Password to send at the end of each Array sent to the AuxSvc (for those who use distro or password protect like distro does).

Message:
+Added event handlers for all Map Checkboxes. This is to keep the UseDif disabled unless a Realm is selected. This also unchecks the UseDif when the Map is unchecked and re-disabled. Mainly for visual appeal (although this will interact with the POLUtils UOConvert.Realms handling for the UOConvert Commandlines in the future)
