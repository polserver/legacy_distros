Some files that might help converting to the new core (now, 099):


** extobjs.cfg **

Changes objtypes back to old values. For the new items (from new boat system), keeps the default.


** itemdesc.cfg.new_boats **

Adds placeholder items with new objypes. This should get you up and running quickly. Add those 
just after definition of objtype 0xF012 in your boat system's itemdesc.cfg.
