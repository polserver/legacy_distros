Files in this package:
druidstaff - listens for events.  When it hears an event, it reads the druidspells.cfg file and
	compares the powerwords of each spell listed there with those spoken.  If it matches, it then
	starts the "castdruidspell" script which does the actual casting.  The reason that the casting is
	done in a seperate script is because otherwise the events keep building up if another spell is 
	cast before the last one was done, which was a big mess.
