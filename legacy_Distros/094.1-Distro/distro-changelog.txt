 Removed in this version:
Two malformed merchant nodes.
Unused scripts/console/console.cfg- the real one is config/console.cfg
Removed pkg/foundations/hooks/onSkillAdv and scripts/include/skillAdv- their functionality is now in pkg/foundations/hooks/attributeCore.

 Known issues:
The motd default text file needs to be changed.
6 of the spawnregions are not spawning correctly- most likely because they are not being generated properly from the cfg file.
ICP is failing to register 13 packages. 
The following errors need to be fixed, as they fill the debug log:
Script Error in 'pkg/systems/housing/signControl.ecl': 
	Call to function SystemFindObjectBySerial:
	Parameter 0: Expected datatype Integer, got datatype Error

Script Error in 'pkg/systems/spawnregion/spawnRegion.ecl': 
	Call to function CreateNpcFromTemplate:
	Parameter 0: Expected datatype String, got datatype Array


 Wish list:
Replace the day/night package.
Make the save game interval readable from a cfg file.
Put the UOR houses back in.
