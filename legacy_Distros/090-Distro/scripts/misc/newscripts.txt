Stuff to do:
===========
  Tailoring: make bolts always have 50 yards, using changes them to stacks of cloth

POL076
------
1.Added "Questie" AI -- NPC for "I want" quests 6/2/99 DCT
2.Added NPCBackpacks.inc. This function returns a storage area that can be used as an NPC's backpack. loot.inc checks this same area when the critter dies, to make sure the loot goes on the body.
3. Added speech.inc and speechgroup.cfg as an initial attempt at a multilevel, generic speech system.

POL075
------
5/xx/99: Rewritten the teleporter/moongatesystem. TODO: make them mg:s 
Ultima style (4 or 5). Right now they only cycle every 5 mins.

5/25/99:
1. Cleanup of some UOBJ_XXX constants-moved from scripts into objtype.inc -Syz

5/24/99:
1. Removed util/skillid.inc; all scripts use include/client.inc now -Syz
2. Changed all spell scripts to use client.inc constants for effects -Syz
     Note, a lot of scripts use FX_SPELL_CURSE and FX_SPELL_BLESS,
           which is probably wrong.

5/22/99:
1. Changed most for-loops that wanted to be foreach-loops to use foreach -Syz
2. Changed spawner to pick a spawn site randomly, rather than first-last -Syz
3. Moved a lot of scripts from ai/ to ai/old; see ai/old/readme.txt -Syz
   This includes vortex_ai; this probably should be rewritten ASAP.
4. Added script for starting equipment generation, starteqp.cfg needs filled. -Syz

POL074
------
5/11/99:
1. Merchants turn toward their patrons when interacting
2. Added house deed functionaility. House deeds can be bought, placed, and keys created.
   All the doors will be locked to the same key. The house sign can be renamed if you have
   the right house key.
3. Defined merchant types Tailor, Leatherworker, Provisioner, Carpenter, Architect
4. Spawns.cfg can have 'rect' entries, and will spawn inside the rectangle specified

POL073
------
5/9/99:

1. Commands to shave hair and beards ( buzz and shave )
2. Makeregs changed to make only non-pagan reagents and places them in a new pack
   rather than cluttering your top-level pack.

5/8/99:
1. Mining:
   * Works on mountainsides!
   * Uses the resource system!
   * Now featuring colored ores! (new ores: bronze, dull copper, copper, onyx(black), pyrite(gold), malachite(green), and azurite(blue)) I'll put up a screenshot of the colors if anyone wants me to make one.
   * The latter ores are harder to find and smelt than the previous ones.
2. Blacksmithy:
   * Un-hardcoded the skill points values for success.
   * only higher skilled smiths can use the new minerals (60 skill minimum: for bronze) to make colored items.
   * Other minor bugfixes/code cleans.
