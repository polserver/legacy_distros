Scripts in this directory are either not used anymore, or require
a serious rewrite before they should be moved back into the 
ai script population.  No attempt will be made to ensure that
these scripts continue to compile; if you want to resurrect one,
feel free, but it may be a lot of work!

Nothing is "wrong" with these scripts - when they were made, they
used the latest script features available.  Now there are newer,
more powerful features, which these scripts would need to use
in order to thrive.
