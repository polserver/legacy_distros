std-magic (POL076)
==================
	11/15/99 Dundee:  	Charged magic items:  Use the same scripts as spells:
				Currently only works on nightsight, and spells mobs can cast.

		cprop charges = number of charges
		cprop spellame = which spell to cast (name of spell script)
		cprop tgtopt = target options for that spell, for example:
				TGTOPT_CHECKLOS+TGTOPT_HARFUL
				TGTOPT_CHECKLOS+TGTOPT_HARFUL
				NOTARGET (for target-self spells)
				TARGETAREA (for area-effect spells)
		cprop tname = the item's True Name (std item-id thing here)
		UseScript ":magic:magicitems"

		Note:  All of the above will be added to HoD with a .makemagic textcommand:
			.makemagic [spellname] t c
			(where t is tgtopt 0 through 3, and c is charges).


	10-27-99 Dundee:	Made it more like spellcasting - castining animation, spellwords, fizzles, etc.
