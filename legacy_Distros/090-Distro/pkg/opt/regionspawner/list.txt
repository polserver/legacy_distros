dospawn.src

	The main spawner.  Launched as a seperate proggy so that it can be updated on the fly.

regionspawn.cfg

	Populates pretty much the whole world.  Edit it.  We probably have npcs that you don't.

regspawner.src

	Launches dospawn every 30 to 45 minutes.

start.src

	Launches regspawner.src.

textcmd\gm\cr.src

	Clears and repops a region.  .cr 3 will clear and repop region 3, etc.

textcmd\gm\depop.src

	Does a shard-wide npc wipe, repop and resets all the counters.  Only kills regionspawned npcs.
