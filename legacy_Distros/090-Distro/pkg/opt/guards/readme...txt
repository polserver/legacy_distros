Disclamers about guards and guards2:

This is due my shard polici of short memory use, guards script will only kill red npcs, guards2 will kill only npcs without guardignore on its npcdesc.

guards is the default, if you whant to change just delete it and rename guards2 to guards. Or change itemdesc controlscript entry to guards2.
