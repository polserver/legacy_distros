Danspawner Instructions

1. Make sure Danspawner is enabled in pkg.cfg

2. Start up POL and let it spawn (it will take a while to spawn the whole world).

3.  To create new spawns with danspawner, simply type (in game) .spawn and choose from the list. The spawn will happen the next cycle that danspawn runs.

4.  To remove a spawn you created, type .despawn and target the NPC you want to 
not spawn anymore.

5.  To add custom NPC's that you have added to your server, simply edit /pol/config/spawndef.cfg and add them there in the same format as the other entries.
