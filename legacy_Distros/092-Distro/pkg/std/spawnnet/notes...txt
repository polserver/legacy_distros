Notes about spawnnet 0.9.5

Due this is a test version I can't garantee that anything will even work, but should without  showing problems.

After instal remember to edit pkg.cfg and set enable to 1, the cmd folder are is the current comand tree.
Remember too that you need to edit death.src and tamed.src. Just use the spawnnet_clear(param) function, use corpse with death and self() with tamed.



The main purpoise of this release is to have better testing since my test shard is showing some problems.

The major new features are:

-New code layout, the core will run twice as fast in the worst case.
-NPC spawn is finished and is working 100%.
-Item and container spawn got revamped and are working pretty well
-The gump menu was updated, the check function too

Item spawn changes:

Now there are 4 flags:
-grouping, alike NPC's one, it makes the spawner creates multiple items at the same time, this amount is set by the Max Amount field (the one below template)
-Container spawn, this one is intended to be used by a rune inside a container, the diference is that the items are created on the container and not on the world. Due some limitations right now you can't use grouping and container spawn together.
-use itemgroup, allow you to use item groups, exactly like npc groups, difering that the cfg is igroup.cfg and the entries must be the hexa num of the item.
-leave b item, this works only if container spawn is disabled; by default all itens under the spawned one are deleted (special items like gs, spawn runes and such are not), setting this flag avoid this


Issues: 
-The new start-up code is not tested, but it's commented on the source, soo ig you want to give it a try just comment the old and uncomment the new one :-)
-I must change the way runes are hidden, soo we can abuse of item.invisible, thanks to pol 88


Container spawn changes:
-now it works very diferent, each rune controls a single container and will be spawning loot inside it until it decays, then creates another one.

-moving spawn, use this if you want containers bot to be created allways above the rune.
-don't check for old items, set this if you want it to allway make new loot, even if the container is filled
-clean old items, delete everything (special items not) on the container before spawning new ones
-leave base items, by default it will delete all items under the new container upon spawn, check this to avoid this.



Other/minor Issues: It's impossible to compile using -i and I have not change the code to use 087 new functions, talking about set_script_options, since set_critical and set_debug will be deprecated.


What's coming with next test release:
-more config options
-possibility of seting a group as a spawn type on cfgs.
-cfg caching, to allow better performance and memory use due new features.
-fast start
-system cmds, that change on-the-fly some configurations.
-new cmds, hopefully I'll finish the gump interface.
