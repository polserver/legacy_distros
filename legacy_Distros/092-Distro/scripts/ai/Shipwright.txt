shipwright npc - version .2
updated April 14, 2000  (zulu@zuluhotel.com)

Here is the shipwright.  Take a look at this package, it has a lot of new ships over the standard architect.  You will have to remove the ship deeds from the architect.

You can place these npc's in the custom houses and they will sell boat deeds. Another good place for them is by docks.

To spawn the new npc, type .createnpc shipwright
