Animal Trainer - version .4
Updated by Zulu (zulu@cadvision.com) April 3, 2000

I have included RoTTer's Stable Keeper script into the animal trainer.
I have updated his code a bit. I have also included Sentack's training
code. I have updated his code a bit.

The animal trainer can train skills for players.
They will stable and return pets for players.
They sell pets and buy pets from players.

It now includes an updated buy/sell routine, you will need the latest
POL package to run this.

To create a npc use the command 
.createnpc animaltrainer
