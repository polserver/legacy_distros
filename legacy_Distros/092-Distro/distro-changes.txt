POL 092:
--------
Note:  Many of the scripts in this release of the distro will NOT work with POL versions older than 092, particularly the housing, dyeitems, boats, and bishopalchemy packages; as well as selected bug fixes, like the one for scrolls inserted into spellbooks.

Also, if you use the included new items file (pol/data/items), make sure you have CheckIntegrity=0 in your pol.cfg file.  Otherwise, you may run into problems with the server not booting due to items being carried on your NPCs having duplicate numbers.

Major contributers to this release:  Madman Across the Water, Zulu, HellRazor, Bishop Ebonhand, Oroborous, Mike Anselmi, Magic, LKx, Talos, Shilohen, and Dundee.  Thanks everyone!

1.  BUG FIXES:

-  Fixed a bug in the doors package where double clicking a door very quickly would sometimes result in the door coming out of its frame.  (Madman Across The Water)
-  Fixed a bug in the tamed creatures AI that allowed players to target non-mobiles when ordering them to attack.  (Oroborous)
-  Bugs fixed in coords.inc.  (Bishop Ebonhand)
-  Bug fixed in the questie.src AI that allowed players to achieve unlimited rewards through an exploit.  (Shilohen)
-  Fixed a bug with Great Hart entries in regionspawn.cfg (pol/pkg/opt/regionspawner).  (Mike Anselmi)
-  Fixed a bug that allowed multiples of the same scroll to be added to a spellbook, increasing its weight.  (Bishop Ebonhand)
-  Fixed a bug in change.src from the Lighting package.  (Zulu)
-  Fixed a minor bug in the BCast text command; it used to send an empty message to all online clients if you just entered .bcast and no text, now it instead displays a useage message to the person using the command.  (HellRazor)
-  Ostards now make the correct hit/miss/death sounds.  (HellRazor)
-  Dye tubs now make the appropriate sound when dying items.  (HellRazor)

2.  NEW/UPDATED PACKAGES:

-  Replaced the pol/pkg/std/dyeitems package with one compatible with POL 092.  (Zulu)
-  Updated the Housing, Boat, and Cartography packages in pol/pkg/std to work correctly with POL 092's new handling of multi's.  (Zulu/Bishop Ebonhand)
-  Added a new standard package for books (sysbook) to pol/pkg/std.  Sysbook takes advantage of POL 092's ability to access the client book interface, and includes numerous pre-written books and support for books spawning in bookcases.  The old book package was moved to the pol/pkg/opt directory as an optional package and disabled.  (Zulu, Bishop Ebonhand, Syzygy).
-  Added a new standard package, serpentpillars.  Allows ships to move between T2A and the olds lands when a player says the correct magic word at the serpent pillars.  (Zulu)
-  Zulu's magic wands package moved from pol/pkg/opt to pol/pkg/std and updated to v0.6 (adds a few new magic wands).  (Zulu)
-  Enticement package added as a standard package.  (LKx)
-  Guildstone package updated to v3.00 and moved from pkg/opt to pkg/std.  Now supports guild wars, allies, titles, icons, chat, colors, and auto destroyguild.  Also, a fix to allow unlimited guild members, and one for guildstone deletes.  See the included README file to convert your data files to the updated package.  (Zulu/Magic)
-  Auction package (pol/pkg/opt) updated to v1.4.  (Zulu)
-  Updated fishing package to make use of math.em instead of math.inc, it was using functions in math.inc that were moved to math.em.  (HellRazor)
-  Added optional package BishopAlchemy, with potion keg support.  (Bishop Ebonhand).
-  Added optional package BankWipe, gets rid of the bankboxes of deleted characters (Jeff Freeman/Zulu).

3.  NPC'S & ITEMS:

-  Added Animal Trainer, Barber, Mapmaker, Gambler, Traveler (see text files in pol/scripts/ai).  Added Hair dye and hair styles (sold by barber).  (Zulu)

-  Buy and sell prices added to spyglass, now sold by mapmaker NPC.  (HellRazor)

4.  CLEANUP AND MISC:

-  Enabled the speech events in the merchant.src AI (as of POL 092, speech events need to be specifically enabled).  (HellRazor)
-  Added "Weight 0" entry to the SecureContainer item in itemdesc.cfg (required as of POL 092).  (HellRazor)
-  A new default data/items.txt file was added.  (Zulu)
-  Removed the pol/pkg/opt/statcap package, this package was already in pol/pkg/std. (Mike Anselmi) 
-  Removed the pol/tips directory (apparently serves no function).  (HellRazor)
-  Removed the pol/misc directory (apparently serves no function).
-  Removed functions from math.inc that were moved to math.em.  (HellRazor)
-  Pol/pkg/std/lightingfoo directory removed, apparently a working directory accidentally left in the 091 distro release.  (HellRazor)
-  Player level text command .reply was erronously removed from the 091 distro.  Needed for use with the .msg command, re-added to the distro.  (HellRazor)
-  Clock.inc updated to add a new function.  (Orborous)
-  New function, PlayMusic, added to include files.  See pol/scripts/include/playmusic_chart.rtf for useage instructions.  (HellRazor)
-  Added Possess/Unpossess as Seer level commands.  Players with Seer access and above can inhabit the bodies of NPC's.  (Dundee/HellRazor)
-  Added support for Possess/Unpossess to chrdeath.src.  (Dundee/HellRazor).
-  The "death" midi music now playes upon character death.  (HellRazor)
-  The .refreshme command now refreshes mana, stanima, and grants nightsight (before it only refreshed stanima).  (HellRazor)


----------------------------------------------------------------

POL091:
- Evaluate Intelligence, Arms Lore, and Anatomy now yield the same messages
  as on OSI.
- Added Myr's message of the day package as an optional package.
- Added Animal Lore back in. Dunno why it went missing.
- When merchants die, their storage areas will be annihilated.
- Updated the doors package.
- Fixed hitscriptinc.inc (it was calling the wrong thing for the anatomy value.)
- Players can log out instantly when in an inn.
- Brought weapon and armor statistics in line with OSI's.
- Updated the lighting package.
- Documentation and updated cfg file for danspawner.
- Added OSI's treasure map locations.
- You will not be allowed to put on a piece of armor that would lower your dex
  to 0 or below. Note that this will not prevent you from drinking a dex potion,
  putting on plate mail, and then letting the potion wear off, but it is a start.
- Added an optional alternate mining package.
- Offer an optional upgrade to Spawnnet. It isn't by Spawnnet's creator, who is
  working on the next version- this is why I made it optional. If you want to use
  this version (and it does fix some things), make sure to use the correct include
  files.
- TUSReadMe removed, as it refers to a web site no longer being maintained.
- Added Zulu's new guildstone package. If you were running an earlier version of
  this package, please refer to the readme in opt/guildstone for how to update your
  data files.
- .setprop should no longer allow you to give someone a higher command level than
  you have.

- Added a spirit speak package and modified login.src to remove the ability to
  hear ghosts on login.
- Updated the optional Arena package.
- Updated the armor equip, unequip, and destroy scripts, and also chrdeath,
  to modify dex_mod instead of dex and also to not effect NPCs.
- Added Dundee's boat package.
- Updated equip.cfg and objtype.inc.
- Cleaned up npcdesc.cfg.
- Fixed equip errors in questie.src.
- Repairing things with blacksmithy should no longer give skill.
- Taming now correctly sets the master of the mount.
- Repsys file corrected.
