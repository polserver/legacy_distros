With this mining-package you can setup up to 32 sorts of ore and 32 sorts of ingots.
Or you can "misuse" and oretype to dig jewels or other stuff. All is configured by 
configfiles ( oretable and ingottable ). The configs are described in the files itself.

To install the package copy the content of this zip into 
Pol\pkg\std\mining
overwriting all existing files

Cause i moved the ore to objecttype 0x6300-0x631F and ingots to 0x6320-0x633F, you might have to adjust some other scripts:
objtype.inc 		change the const's of Ingots and ore to the new numbers - and 
			recompile all ingots/ore-using scripts ;)
blacksmithy.src, make_blacksmith_items.src, tinkering.src
			adjust to the new Item-ID's and maybe others 
menus.cfg		adjust Item-ID for Goldingot

If you have a running system - you could have other problems - if already ingots or 
orepiles are existing, the server will crah after reboot, cause the old numbers aren`t 
found anymore. I fixed this by replacing the old ID-numbers with the new ones in:
Pol\data\items.txt
Pol\data\npcequip.txt
Pol\data\objects.txt
Pol\data\pcequip.txt
Pol\data\items.txt
Pol\data\storage.txt

If this would be too much work, you can let the old numbers exist and make additional ones
maybe - but you have to change some parts of my scripts then.
