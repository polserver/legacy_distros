POL091:
- Evaluate Intelligence, Arms Lore, and Anatomy now yield the same messages
  as on OSI.
- Added Myr's message of the day package as an optional package.
- Added Animal Lore back in. Dunno why it went missing.
- When merchants die, their storage areas will be annihilated.
- Updated the doors package.
- Fixed hitscriptinc.inc (it was calling the wrong thing for the anatomy value.)
- Players can log out instantly when in an inn.
- Brought weapon and armor statistics in line with OSI's.
- Updated the lighting package.
- Documentation and updated cfg file for danspawner.
- Added OSI's treasure map locations.
- You will not be allowed to put on a piece of armor that would lower your dex
  to 0 or below. Note that this will not prevent you from drinking a dex potion,
  putting on plate mail, and then letting the potion wear off, but it is a start.
- Added an optional alternate mining package.
- Offer an optional upgrade to Spawnnet. It isn't by Spawnnet's creator, who is
  working on the next version- this is why I made it optional. If you want to use
  this version (and it does fix some things), make sure to use the correct include
  files.
- TUSReadMe removed, as it refers to a web site no longer being maintained.
- Added Zulu's new guildstone package. If you were running an earlier version of
  this package, please refer to the readme in opt/guildstone for how to update your
  data files.
- .setprop should no longer allow you to give someone a higher command level than
  you have.


POL090_1:
- Added a spirit speak package and modified login.src to remove the ability to
  hear ghosts on login.
- Updated the optional Arena package.
- Updated the armor equip, unequip, and destroy scripts, and also chrdeath,
  to modify dex_mod instead of dex and also to not effect NPCs.
- Added Dundee's boat package.
- Updated equip.cfg and objtype.inc.
- Cleaned up npcdesc.cfg.
- Fixed equip errors in questie.src.
- Repairing things with blacksmithy should no longer give skill.
- Taming now correctly sets the master of the mount.
- Repsys file corrected.
