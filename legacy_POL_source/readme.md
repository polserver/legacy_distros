This directory contains older POL Core source code that predates our transfer
from CVS to GitHub.

There are two (2) folders: oldPOL2_2007, POL_2008 and a ZIP file
namedPOLCoreCVSBackup_2006.zip.

The two folders are from local repos Madman Across the Water found on an old hard drive.
They are from 2007 and 2008 respectively. At least that is what Nando guessed based on
the creation dates of the files.

The ZIP file is a server side backup from a CVS server, also contributed by Madman Across
the Water. The files contained in it are not intended to be used as they contain a lot of
versioning data within the source files. We intend to convert it to Git format at some point
so that the version history of POL can be examined. We welcome anyone who would like to
attempt to do the conversion.

These files are stored here for archival and reference purposes only and may not be
fully functional Core source code. The POL Development Team does not guarantee
the functionality of this code and will not provide any support for those who attempt
to use the code. The POL Development Team is not responsible for any damage or
loss of data to your system if you choose to attempt to build and use the binaries.
