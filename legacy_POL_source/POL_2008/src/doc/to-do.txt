TO-DO before next release:
==========================
1. Linux: HTTP freeze http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pol-core-test/message/7138
    (Approach: a separate thread that will watch a counter of the last time each thread passed its
     game-lock checkpoint.  When no thread has obtained the lock for over 30 seconds, report
     on their checkpoints.  This will tell which thread has the lock, and where it is)

Other
=====

deal with NPC good/neutral/evil changing on npcdesc reload
0-height items on multi floors are invisible (client always draws floor over the item)


Planning
========

096 - Vestal Virgin
    Syzygy
        POL native mapfiles
        Custom packet hooks
        Look into what happens when an offline mobile is moved. (MoveCharacterToLocation)
    Unknown
        Full script interface to tip window? (blocking, a la gumps etc)
        Admin login auto bumps timing-out characters (or ignores)
    Syzygy
        store 'gotten item' on a layer
        Find memory leaks in ecompile
        multi walkon scripts / registration management
        given item contianer objtype

097 - The Coregina
    Slogan
	"POL - Providing mature development for 7 years...
	 Not sure what happened after that though.. now the drinkers have it... "

        Remove all stat advancement code from the core. This has been depreciated for
        a long while, but left in for some odd reason? The following is a start:
            AdvanceStatsDueToSkillUse( USKILLID skillid )  -- COMPLETED
            unsigned short get_str_points( USKILLID skillid );  -- COMPLETED
            unsigned short get_int_points( USKILLID skillid );  -- COMPLETED
            unsigned short get_dex_points( USKILLID skillid );  -- COMPLETED
            unsigned short SkillHandlerElem::StatAdv::get_points() const  --COMPLETED
            unsigned short get_points() const; -- COMPLETED
            StatAdv(); and it's related functions -- COMPLETED
            StatAdv stradv; and related -- COMPLETED
            StatAdv intadv; and related -- COMPLETED
            StatAdv dexadv; and related -- COMPLETED
    MuadDib & Shinigami
        Targeting needs to be revamped. Especially handling of "kill" packet sent to
        client instead of killing the request in core when a new cursor request is called
        over an existing.  -- COMPLETED
        Target handling needs better response if it recieves a target reply for an invalid
        sequence handler (invalid cursor ID). -- COMPLETED (I think)
    Austin
        Rewrite .EM support for better handling. Create and reorganize them into files such as
        attributes.em, map.em, etc etc. -- COMPLETED
    MuadDib
        Remove void unload_skill_scripts(), depreciated and unused. --COMPLETED
        Remove void load_zones(), depreciated and unused.  --COMPLETED
    MuadDib
        Fix error reports and instances of weapon.cfg and wepndesc.cfg in core messages. --COMPLETED
        Fix error reports and instances of armor.cfg and armrdesc.cfg in core messages.  --COMPLETED
    MuadDib
        Remove MoveItem*/MoveCharacter* functions that was depreciated by the new
        MoveObjectToLocation function in 096.  --COMPLETED
    MuadDib
        Check into possibility of changing send_full_statmsg and similar to be able
        to handle AOS support. -- NEEDS DEBUGGED AND AN ISSUE FIXED
    MuadDib
        Check into core supporting the other resistances but not be required. AR is
        still one of the resistances in AOS+. -- MOVED TO 098 DUE TO REASONS
    MuadDib
        Luck/Followers can be totally ignored in AOS statbar if core supported. Damage might
        be considered to be included in the packet. -- IGNORED
    Austin
	    Allow config files to be at the root of a package or in its /config/ subdirectory.
	    Similarly to how include files work. --COMPLETED
    Austin
	    Deprecate the need for skills.cfg. Keep necessary information in attributes.cfg and have
	    uoskills.cfg point to the attributes (instead of skills.cfg) --COMPLETED
    UnKnown
        Multi Walkon script support. Should remember it only needs checked when first walking onto
        a multi/component, and no release their reference for it, until they walk off it. Handle this
        similar to regional zones for best result maybe??
    UnKnown
        Rework sending items to client when they are on a multi (and not a component of the multi).
        OSI handles this laggish issue by not sending items (Mobs and their equipped items they send though)
        until the player has walked onto the multi or one of it's components. Helps blackholing and saves
        bandwidth.
    MuadDib
        Implement 0xD1 Packet from client (Logout Status)
    UnKnown
        Add Pushthrough=0/1 In configs for the compiled realms in UOConvert. Besides having the flag in
        the config for each realm (default is 0 when written), it will need to be read during sending the
        realms. To enable this, according to testing by others (should we consider this reliable?) you
        must send the Cursor Hue Felucca packet, followed by a season, and then the Cursor Hue packet again.
    UnKnown
        Should we consider a Season=# for each of the realms? OSI does this similar, because Felucca is normal
        in the map/statics, but it uses the Desolate Season. this would give admins the ability to control
        the base season like OSI does, without having to script it in over the fact we have this hardcoded.
        -- COMPLETE
    MuadDib
        It was reported a long time ago, about SetWarMode() for players not updating the client correctly.
        Look into this possibility, and fix it, if possible via packets.  -- NOT TRUE -- COMPLETED
    MuadDib
        Add NPC.allignment for npcs. Return string. If it cannot be done without saving to npcs.txt, then
        have it based off hue for faster access. -- COMPLETED -- AUSTIN
    MuadDib
        Check rename instances for items and mobiles (multis too?), so that they resend the 0xD6 object cache
        for clients to update tooltips correctly.  -- COMPLETED
    Shinigami
        Fix? clientinfo member on linux cores.
    Shinigami
        Remove known Memory Leaks (cfg and ecl-file handling) if possible.
    Shinigami
        Fix? Issue with timeout not working under linux cores (Inactivity timeout).
    MuadDib
        Fix his inability to work with linux releated issues.
    UnKnown
        FindSubstance()'s makeinuse ability needs to add to the reserved_to_me list.
        find_sumof_objtype_noninuse and consume noninuse, etc, need to check the
        reserved list, and reserved if it is in the list. Defeats the purpose of
        noninuse, BUT, it should work if the same script is the one that reserved
        it anyway, right?
    UnKnown
        Custom Housing finished and fully implemented.
    UnKnown
        systemfindobjectbyserial no longer finds multi's serials.
    UnKnown
        Check insertscript not recieving existing stack info correctly via the
        MoveItemToContainer core command.
    UnKnown
        Tooltip.cfg - Format based for UObj class templates for tooltips. Hardcoded entries of course,
        unless someone knows a non-static way to add this for members etc. Doesn't need to be overloaded.
        just the basics needed. Tooltips can expand easily enough without hurting the server as much.
    MuadDib
        Rewrite MenuItem() and AddMenuItem to accept and use color entry for the packet. -- COMPLETED
    MuadDib
        Add 3DParticle Effect for supporting new spell graphics, etc, without user relying on special
        packet functions to make it.
    MuadDib
        OpenWebsite() function. -- COMPLETED
    UnKnown
        Cliloc SendSys/PrintAbove/PrintAbovePvt commands. No need for cliloc affix just yet :)
        -- COMPLETED
    UnKnown
        Support for new gump packets.
    Adam
        Optimize out the unused config files required by core, and no-longer-used/needed
        code in the spells.cpp from the old spell system.
    MuadDib
		Add polsys.em command IncRev() to increase revision via script. Allows scripts
		to force updates for custom changes involving tooltip hooks. TO cover things such
		as race, graphic, hidden, concealed, etc that we do not auto increv() in core cuz
		no basic/standard need. -- COMPLETED VIA INCREVISION();
    MuadDib
		Rewrite IncRev() commands to also resend the object cache request to client.
		Update all places in npc and items/UObject/uoscrobject for increasing revision
		-- COMPLETED AS NEED TO BE FOR NOW.
    Austin
         Remove built in commands and give script access needed to replace .set, .armor and .privs
         --COMPLETED

    UnKnown
        Color in ListStatics* - we've to add'em to realm-folder/uoconvert first.

098 - BAW (Beer and Waffles)
    UnKnown
        Check into core supporting the other resistances but not be required. AR is
        still one of the resistances in AOS+.
    UnKnown
        If all AOS+ Resistances are added to storing on armor, mobs, etc, then we might
        want to consider a new way of "saving" them so as not to bloat all data files
        with 4 resistances per. Maybe single entry somehow.
    UnKnown
        Check into possibilities of extending what could be hashed together in the
        saved data files to compress data file size and speed up save/load times.

        More UOKR support. Additional gump packet for UOKR added. Will need to look into new packet
