Possible add an option to do full dumps instead of minidumps? I think in some of these cases the data would have helped.

    possible a client refers to a deleted character? or vice versa?
    or, maybe when a character is deleted, its tasks aren't all removed from teh task scheduler?

    Try getting a ptr to the executor before deleting so we can see what it is
    uoemod.cpp, line 133, don't assume the chr has a client?
    Try having a client put up a textentry gump, then shut down the server to try to replicate this.
    Or, put up the textentry gump, disconnect, then shut down during the logout timeout
